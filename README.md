The Mini-App is a web page that shows how the [Concordant platform](https://concordant.io/software) works, and demonstrates each of the CRDT types we implement.

This repository contains two versions of the Mini-app :
- A local version, only using our [CRDT library](https://gitlab.inria.fr/concordant/software/c-crdtlib).
- An online version, using our Concordant platform API. See our [live demo](https://demo.concordant.io/crdt-demo/index.html).

The main repository is in [the Inria gitlab](https://gitlab.inria.fr/concordant/software/mini-app/) (this is where you can post tickets).  There is an identical clone in [GitHub](https://github.com/concordant/software/mini-app/) (tickets here might be ignored).
